    <h2 Style="color:black;">Experience</h2>
    <p Style="font-size: x-large; color: black;">My first week at AkiraChix was all about adjusting to the new program, everyday being a learning opportunity. I loved how the staff was very welcoming and ready to support us to make it easier for us to adapt.</p>
